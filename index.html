 <h2 style=font-size:30px;> My life: </h2>	
 <p style=font-size:20px;> My full name is Zeeshan Jamil Kurd, but you can call me Zee for short. I was born on the 1st of <br>
February 2003, so I am currently 18 and I’m so close to getting my driver’s license (1 Month away). <br>
I live in the west side of Melbourne in the suburb of Werribee. I grew up there my whole life with <br>
my parents and my sister.  My Mother was originally from India and my Father, from Pakistan. I <br>
graduated in 2020 from Werribee Secondary College. I am doing my first year of a Bachelor of <br>
Information Technology at RMIT and its going pretty good so far. You can find me doing one of four <br>
things every day, in my room playing games with my friends, Working at my local Kmart, at the clubs <br>
with the boys or eating good food. </p>

<h2 style=font-size:30px;> Interest in IT </h2>
<p style=font-size:20px;>I’ve had an interest in IT since I was born, from the latest game console on the market, to the latest <br>
advancement in the technology in phones. The smallest feature added to new technology is always the <br>
thing that excites me the most. When you look at pictures of the first iPhone that was created you can <br>
see how small (yet chunky) and useless a mobile phone was, with little to no features, now I look in my <br>
pocket and see a computer that can do everything that the very first iPhone could do and 1000 other <br>
things. This advancement had taken place in under 10 years, with new phones coming out every year, each <br>
phone better and more efficient than the last. The amount of hardware that was engineered to fit into <br>
a such a small device amazes me, compared to 10 years ago and inspires me to achieve the same level of<br>
 advancement in the coming years. I want to be able to help pioneer technology into the next generation <br>
of technology as phone companies have done over the years. Not only phone companies like apple and <br>
Samsung, but other companies that have created future tech in the present era like Tesla and google. <br>
Tesla is another major company that inspires me to want to create technology that no one has seen before <br>
and technology that is believed to be "of the future". As many others, Elon Musk is an idol of mine. <br>
His journey from small town kid, to creating PayPal, to creating SpaceX and now Tesla, inspires me to <br>
continue studying in the IT industry and hopefully get the chance to work on projects within his companies. </p>

<h2 style=font-size:30px;> RMIT </h2>
<p style=font-size:20px;> I have heard many great things from past and current second year students describing the buildings of RMIT looking beautiful, as well as their fantastic facilities that allow for a creative and accepting environment for students. Not only did these comments convince me to choose RMIT for my studying, but also most of my close friends to attend RMIT for their studies. A combination of both my friends attending RMIT and the great commendations persuaded me to choose RMIT. </p>
