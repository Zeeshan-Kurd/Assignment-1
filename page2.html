<h2 style=font-size:30px;> RMIT </h2>
<p style=font-size:20px;> I have heard many great things from past and current second year students describing the buildings of RMIT looking beautiful, as well as their fantastic facilities that allow for a creative and accepting environment for students. Not only did these comments convince me to choose RMIT for my studying, but also most of my close friends to attend RMIT for their studies. A combination of both my friends attending RMIT and the great commendations persuaded me to choose RMIT. </p>

 <h2 style=font-size:30px;> What do I expect to learn at RMIT?: </h2>
<p style=font-size:20px;>During my studies at RMIT, I want to further my knowledge in IT, specifically programming. As I have already undertaken a software <br>
development course prior to coming to RMIT during Year 12, I have a basic understanding of programming. As I only worked with Python <br>
and Visual Basic, I want to learn more complex coding languages and gain greater understanding of the logic around programming. </p>
<h2 style=font-size:30px;> Ideal Job: </h2>
<p style=font-size:20px;>My ideal Job would be a backend software developer for a company. I found a Company, AUSTCORP, seeking for a junior Software Developer<br>
 in Melbourne to hire. The position is offering a job where an individual can work in team, designing and creating projects, as well as <br>
improving their current systems. Not only will they be working on projects, but they will also need talking to stakeholders and others <br>
to understand exactly what they want for the outcome of the project. To apply for this position, you will need to have prior knowledge <br>
on Ruby or have 2-3 years of experience designing or creating frontends/backends in another language such as Java, C#, Python, C++. As <br>
I am currently learning the basics of Python in my course, I am very underexperienced for this role. To achieve the required experience <br>
I will need to complete my course and learn another language other than python then go on to work for another company for 2-3 years 
<br>with either python or another language. This may take me up to 6 years to obtain the required experience. AUSTCORP would also like <br>
individuals to be smart, to show them that I am smart I need to achieve high grades in all my classes. Another thing they request is <br>
good communication skills. I believe that currently I have average communication skills. By the end of my course, I expect to have <br>
gained greater communication skills so that should help me get not only this role but a position prior to this one. Aside from the <br>
requirements of this position, this job is appealing to me as most of the requirements of this position is programming which is what I <br>
want to do. The salary for this job is also appealing to me as they are offering, $80k - $110k, which is ideal for me. AS well as the <br>
salary, I can work from home for 2 days while only going to the office for three days. This will allow for me to still do other things <br>
that I enjoy and not lose interest in my hobbies.</p>
