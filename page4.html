<h2 style=font-size:30px;text-align:center> Project Idea</h2>
<h2 style=font-size:25px;> Overview </h2>
<p style=font-size:15px;> y project will be a simple map app on mobile devices (Android/Apple) that shows a variety of details abouts all the clubs in Melbourne. It will display the location, the fastest route to get there from your current position, how much the entry fee is and any discount codes that can be applied and other details listed in the description view. It will take the descriptions from the clubs’ websites. It will have an easy-to-use user interface and will be active 24/7. Users will be able to create an account and sign in then view the map.  </p>
<h2 style=font-size:25px;> Motivation</h2>
<p style=font-size:15px;> Instead of Users taking their time to go on google maps and try to find the names and locations of different clubs, they will be able to go on the app and discover all the clubs around them within seconds and compare each club to find the perfect one for them. Using the application will cut down the time taken to find a club which will increase the amount of time spent at the club. Currently, there is no app dedicated to displaying all the clubs in Melbourne to users.</p>
<h2 style=font-size:25px;> Tools and Technologies </h2>
<p style=font-size:15px;> In order to create the club app, an Apple Mac that is capable of running XCode to program is required. This should not be hard to access as XCode is free on all Macs. I am able to use my own Mac to code or a Mac supplied by RMIT.  The programming language that I would like to use is Swift.  A phone may also be required to test the final product. </p>
<h2 style=font-size:25px;> Skills Required </h2>
<p style=font-size:15px;> To create this project, programming experience will be needed. This experience can be for either Java or Swift as they are the main languages used to create apps and are what I want to create the app in. I alone will not be able to create the app, I will need others to help me and someone with knowledge in creating apps to guide me. It is possible for me to find someone with this knowledge, so this project is relatively feasible. I will not require any special hardware, just a computer to program the app on. </p>
<h2 style=font-size:25px;> Outcome </h2>
<p style=font-size:15px;>If this project is successful, then people will have an easier time finding a club that like out of all the clubs in Melbourne. They will cut down on time searching for a club and the directions on how to get there as the app will have all of that already prepared for the user. Right now, there is no app that’s sole purpose is to help users find and compare clubs. Map apps are able to find clubs near you but are not able to filter and compare different clubs. As the app is created for Clubs only, there will be a lot more customization for users to find their perfect club. It will also help users that are new to the clubbing scene have an easier time finding a club that they will enjoy. </p>
