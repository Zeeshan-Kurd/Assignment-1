<h2 style=font-size:30px;text-align:center> Project Idea</h2>
<h2 style=font-size:30px;> Description</h2>
<p style=font-size:20px;text-align:justify;>This app will be designed for those who are not so familiar with clubs. There is no set name for the application as of now, but it will have a user-friendly interface for those who decide to consume alcohol before heading to their preferred club. Each club will have an icon, so it is easy to spot on the map. Clubs will be able to promote their clubs on the app which will allow for theirs and other popular clubâ€™s icons to be larger than others to attract more customers. The user will be able to filter out all the clubs based on different categories such as music, average age of attendees, distance, occupant size, popularity/wait time, rating, opening/closing hours, dress code, entry cost and overall cost for food and drinks. Once clubs are filtered, only those that fit the filtered categories are displayed on the screen. Users are then able to select multiple clubs and compare the descriptions of each. The descriptions will include the previous categories as well as pictures of the inside and the outside of the club that will be supplied from the club websites. Comments can also be added by others to let future users know what current users think about certain clubs. If users like a club they can favourite it.  A friend feature will be added so that users can add friends and see what clubs their friends enjoy. This may develop over time to become a social media platform where users are able to post their own photos attached to a club and are able to communicate with others. Users may also be able to announce that they will be at a certain club so that their friends can see. This will mean while users a searching for a club they can see if their friend has visited it before or left a review on it. Allowing users to add their friends makes the user feel more comfortable on the app which will boost the user friendliness. Another feature that can be added is an achievements section that rewards the user for completing tasks. The achievements section would work like a normal game would, the user would perform an action within the app then receive trophies along with rewards such as discount codes. Examples of the tasks could be, visiting 5 new clubs, then 10 new clubs, adding a certain number of friends or even leaving a review of a club. This will incline the user to complete these tasks, allowing for them to show off their trophies to their friends and possibly earn discounts on certain clubs. </p>
